## description
    This is a refactor project demonstrating understanding of CSS styling structure and HTML syntax.  I consilidated CSS elements to reduce the amount of code, for example: I removed redundant class element like the footer class.  The footer .class was removed in the HTML file and replaced with the footer symantic element.  This allowed me to reduce repeated elements in the CSS.style that repeated with identicle colors and text sizes.  Assigning classes in the HTML helped me ahieve the same goal.  By assigning IDs to "search-engine-optimization", "online-reputation-management", and "social-media-marketing" and labeling as the same class ".product", I was able to consolidate CSS elements for the size of the images.  h2 and h3 elements were also consilidated due to assigning classes.  The CSS for the text next to the ".product" was also consolidated due to the .class assigned to the HTML.  Symantic elements were added so that anyone who looks at the code, easily knows what code relates to each element on the website.  The order of CSS code needed to be changed to flow along with the HTML for quick references.
